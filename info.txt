What is Gen AI ?
Gen AI refers to a class of Artificial Intelligence models that can create 
new content - such as text, images, audio, code,or Video - that 
resembles human - created data.



LLMs based apps like ChatGpt

Diffusion models for images

Code generating LLMs like CodeLLama
TTS models like ElevenLabs

Video gen models like Sora



Gen AI VS Traditional AI :

Traditional AI is about finding patterns in data and giving predictions.

Gen AI is about learning the distribution of data so that it can generate a 
new sample from it.
The best part of Gen AI is that it can mimic humans

Application Areas:

Creative and Business Writing
Software Development
Customer Support
Education
Designing


Goal - To hire a backend engineer!
 creating a JD
 Posting the JD to a job platform
 Shortlisting
 Interviewing
 Rolling an offer letter
 Onboarding

 

 What is Agentic AI?
 Agentic Ai is a type of AI that take up a task or goal from a user and then work toward 
 completing it on its own, with minimal human guidance.
 It plans, takes action, adapts to changes, and seeks help only when necessary.


Agentic AI Characteristics -
  Autonomous
  Goal Oriented
  Planning
  Reasoning
  Adaptability
  Context Awareness


Autonomy : it refers to AI system's ability to make decisions and take 
actions on its own to achieve goal, without needing step-by-step human instructions.

Goal Oriented : AI system operates with a persistent objective in mind and continuosly
directs its actions to achieve that objective, rather than just responding to 
isolated prompts.

Planning : Planning is the agent's ability to break down high-level goal into structured sequence of
actions or subgoals and decide the best path to achieve the desired outcome.

Reasoning : it is the cognitive process through which an Agentic ai system interprets
information, draws conclusions, and makes decisions - both while planning ahead and while executing
actions in real time.

Adaptibility : it is the agent's ability to modify its plans, strategies, or actions in response
to unexpected conditions - all while staying aligned with goal.

Context Awareness : it is the agent's ability to understand, retain, and utilize relevant information
from the ongoing task, past interactions, user prefences, and environmental cues to make
better decisions throughout a multi-step process.


Components of Agentic system
 Brain - Generally LLM
 Orchestrator - LangGraph
 Tools - 
 Memory - 
 Supervisor - HITL



LangChain VS LangGraph

- LangChain do not have nested worlflows
- LangChain do not have Human in loop
- LangChain do not have event based pause, LangChain has to add Glue code.
- LangGraph is fault Tolerant

LangGraph is an Orchestration framework that enables you to build 
stateful, multi-step and event-driven workflows using LLMs
