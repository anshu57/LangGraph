Title: Network meta-analysis on the effects of finerenone versus SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and renal benefits of finerenone, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with network meta-analysis. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline and Embase covering January 1, 2000 to December 30, 2021. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing finerenone, SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA in diabetics with CKD were selected. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the two drugs and finerenone indirectly. Results were reported as risk ratio (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: 18 RCTs involving 51,496 patients were included. Finerenone reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), renal outcome and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) (RR [95% CI]; 0.88 [0.80-0.97], 0.86 [0.79-0.93], 0.79 [0.67,0.92], respectively). SGLT-2i were associated with reduced risks of MACE (RR [95% CI]; 0.84 [0.78-0.90]), renal outcome (RR [95% CI]; 0.67 [0.60-0.74], HHF (RR [95% CI]; 0.60 [0.53-0.68]), all-cause death (ACD) (RR [95% CI]; 0.89 [0.81-0.91]) and cardiovascular death (CVD) (RR [95% CI]; 0.86 [0.77-0.96]) compared to placebo. GLP-1 RA were associated with a lower risk of MACE (RR [95% CI]; 0.86 [0.78-0.94]). SGLT2i had significant effect in comparison to finerenone (finerenone vs SGLT2i: RR [95% CI]; 1.29 [1.13-1.47], 1.31 [1.07-1.61], respectively) and GLP-1 RA (GLP-1 RA vs SGLT2i: RR [95% CI]; 1.36 [1.16-1.59], 1.49 [1.18-1.89], respectively) in renal outcome and HHF. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA and finerenone were comparable in MACE, ACD and CVD. SGLT2i significantly decreased the risk of renal events and HHF compared with finerenone and GLP-1 RA. Among GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 analogues showed significant effect in reducing cardiovascular events compared with exendin-4 analogues.
