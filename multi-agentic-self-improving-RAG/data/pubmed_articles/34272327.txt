Title: Effects of Dapagliflozin in Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin significantly reduced risk of kidney failure and prolonged survival in patients with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Adults with eGFR of 25-75 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200-5000 mg/g had been randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo. Here, we conducted a prespecified analysis of dapagliflozin's effects in patients with stage 4 CKD (eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) at baseline. The primary end point was a composite of time to >/=50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESKD, or kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary end points were a kidney composite (same as the primary end point but without cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause death. RESULTS: A total of 293 participants with stage 4 CKD received dapagliflozin and 331 received placebo. Patients with stage 4 CKD randomized to dapagliflozin experienced a 27% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -2 to 47%) reduction in the primary composite endpoint, and 29% (-2 to 51%), 17% (-53 to 55%), and 32% (-21 to 61%) reductions in the kidney, cardiovascular and mortality endpoints, respectively, relative to placebo. Interaction P-values were 0.22, 0.13, 0.63, and 0.95, respectively, comparing CKD stages 4 versus 2/3. The eGFR slope declined by 2.15 and 3.38 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (P=0.005). Patients treated with dapagliflozin or placebo had similar rates of serious adverse events and adverse events of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stage 4 CKD and albuminuria, the effects of dapagliflozin were consistent with those observed in the DAPA-CKD trial overall, with no evidence of increased risks.
