Title: Summary of the Belmont Report Principles for Clinical Research
1. Respect for Persons: This principle requires that individuals be treated as autonomous agents and that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. This translates to robust informed consent processes. Inclusion/exclusion criteria must not unduly target or coerce vulnerable populations, such as economically disadvantaged individuals, prisoners, or those with severe cognitive impairments, unless the research is directly intended to benefit that population.
2. Beneficence: This principle involves two complementary rules: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. The criteria must be designed to select a population that is most likely to benefit and least likely to be harmed by the intervention. The risks to subjects must be reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
3. Justice: This principle concerns the fairness of distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. The selection of research subjects must be equitable. Criteria should not be designed to exclude certain groups without a sound scientific or safety-related justification. For example, excluding participants based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status is unjust unless there is a clear rationale related to the drug's mechanism or risk profile.
